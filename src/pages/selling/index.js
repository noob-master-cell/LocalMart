// This file serves as the entry point for the Lost & Found feature section.
// It exports the main component for this feature, `LostAndFoundSection`.
// This pattern helps in organizing feature-specific components and allows for cleaner imports.

import LostAndFoundSection from "./LostAndFoundSection.jsx";

// Default export of the LostAndFoundSection component.
export default LostAndFoundSection;

// Alternative named export style (if preferred for consistency across the project):
// export { default as LostAndFoundSection } from './LostAndFoundSection.jsx';
