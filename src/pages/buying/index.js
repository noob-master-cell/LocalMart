// This file serves as the entry point for the "Buying" feature section.
// It exports the main component for this feature, `BuyingSection`.
// This pattern helps in organizing feature-specific components and allows for cleaner imports.

import BuyingSection from "./BuyingSection.jsx";

// Default export of the BuyingSection component.
export default BuyingSection;

// Alternative named export style (if preferred for consistency):
// export { default as BuyingSection } from './BuyingSection.jsx';
